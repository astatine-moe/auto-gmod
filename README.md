# Auto GMOD Server

Made this as a way to collaborate on a mod list for a server without each other knowing what's being added, so when we start the server we can all be surprised.
It simply auto adds mods to a GMod server and a collection, this is useful for when you have a server with a lot of mods and you want to add more, you can just add the mod to the collection and it will be added to the server.
